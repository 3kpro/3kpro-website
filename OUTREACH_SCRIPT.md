# Local Business Website Outreach Script

## The Strategy: Local & Personal vs. Corporate Agencies

**Your Unique Advantage:**
- You're local (same community)
- You're one person (not a faceless agency)
- You respond within hours (not days)
- You meet face-to-face (build trust)
- You care about their success (reputation matters locally)

**Their Pain Points:**
- Agencies quote $5K-10K (too expensive)
- Agencies are impersonal (you're ticket #4821)
- Agencies take weeks/months (you work fast)
- Agencies upsell everything (you're transparent)
- Agencies don't understand local businesses

---

## Outreach Method #1: In-Person Visit (BEST)

### Why This Works:
- 10x higher success rate than email
- Build instant rapport
- They can't ignore you
- Shows you're serious and local
- Older business owners trust face-to-face

### The Approach:

**Step 1: Dress professionally but not stuffy**
- Business casual (nice jeans + button-up shirt)
- Bring business cards (Vistaprint, $20 for 500)
- Bring tablet/laptop to show examples

**Step 2: Walk in during slow hours**
- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM or 2 PM (avoid lunch rush)
- Avoid Mondays (busy) and Fridays (owners often gone)

**Step 3: Opening Line (30 seconds)**
```
"Hi, my name is James. I'm a local web developer here in [city].

I noticed [business name] has incredible reviews on Google -
4.8 stars with 200+ reviews, that's impressive!

But I couldn't find your website, and honestly, that surprised me
because you're clearly one of the best [plumbers/contractors/etc.]
in the area.

I help local businesses like yours get found online.
Do you have a minute to chat?

If not, I can come back at a better time."
```

**Step 4: Handle Objections**

**Objection 1:** "We don't need a website, we get customers from referrals."
```
"That's great! Word of mouth is the best marketing.

But here's what I'm seeing: When someone refers you, the first thing
people do is Google your business to check you out.

If they don't find a website, they might call your competitor instead.

I'm not asking you to change your marketing - just make sure you don't
lose the referrals you're already getting.

Can I show you something real quick? [Pull up competitor's website]
This is [competitor name]. When people Google them, this is what they see.

When people Google you, they see... [show Google Business page with no website link].

Which one looks more trustworthy?"
```

**Objection 2:** "How much does it cost?"
```
"Great question. Most agencies charge $5K-10K and take 2-3 months.

I charge $2,000 one-time, and I'll have your site live in 3 weeks.

That includes:
- Custom website designed for your business
- Works perfectly on phones (that's where 70% of searches happen)
- Contact form that emails you directly
- Google Maps integration
- FREE hosting - no monthly fees ever
- Domain name registration ($15/year)

One-time payment. No subscriptions. No surprises.

And here's the best part: I'm local. If something breaks, you can
call me or I can stop by. You're not dealing with some call center
in another state."
```

**Objection 3:** "I need to think about it / talk to my partner."
```
"Absolutely, that's smart. Here's my card.

I'll tell you what - I'm going to put together a quick mockup of what
your website could look like. No charge, no obligation.

Can I get your email? I'll send it to you in a few days, and if you
like it, we move forward. If not, no hard feelings.

I just want to show you what's possible.

Also, I'm running a special this month - first 3 clients get $500 off
because I'm building my portfolio. So if you decide in the next week,
you'd be at $1,500 instead of $2,000.

Sound fair?"
```

**Step 5: Close with next step**
```
"Perfect! I'll get that mockup to you by Friday.

Here's my card with my email and phone number.

Oh, and here's a few examples of sites I've built:
[show 3kpro.services on your phone/tablet]

This is my business site. I practice what I preach!

I'll be in touch soon. Thanks for your time!"
```

## Outreach Method #2: Email (If you can't visit in person)

### Subject Lines (Use One):

```
Subject: [Business Name] - I noticed something on Google
Subject: Question about [Business Name]'s online presence
Subject: Local web developer - [Business Name]
```

### Email Template (Keep it SHORT - 150 words max):

```
Hi [Owner Name or "there"],

My name is James, and I'm a web developer here in [City].

I came across [Business Name] on Google and noticed you have incredible reviews
(4.8 stars - that's amazing!), but I couldn't find a website.

As someone who builds sites for local businesses, I know how many potential customers
check online before calling. Without a website, some of those leads might be going to
your competitors.

I specialize in simple, affordable websites for local businesses like yours:
• $2,000 one-time (no monthly fees)
• FREE lifetime hosting
• Live in 3 weeks
• Mobile-friendly & fast

I'm not a big agency - just a local developer who wants to help businesses in our
community succeed.

Would you be interested in a quick 15-minute call to discuss?

Best regards,
James
james@3kpro.services
[Your Phone Number]
3kpro.services
```

### Follow-Up Email (Send 3 days later if no response):

```
Subject: Re: Question about [Business Name]'s online presence

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my email from earlier this week.

I get it - you're busy running your business. But I wanted to make sure you saw this
because I think it could really help you grow.

I'm offering a special deal this month: $1,500 (normally $2,000) for the first 3
clients, because I'm building my local portfolio.

That includes:
✓ Custom website
✓ FREE hosting (no monthly fees, ever)
✓ Domain name
✓ Live in 3 weeks

I can send you a free mockup of what your site could look like - no obligation.

Interested? Just reply "yes" and I'll get started.

Thanks,
James
```

## Outreach Method #3: Phone Call (Cold Call Script)

### Best Times to Call:
- Tuesday/Wednesday/Thursday
- 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM OR 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- Never call Monday mornings or Friday afternoons

### The Script:

**Opening (15 seconds):**
```
"Hi, is this [Owner Name]? Great!

My name is James, and I'm a web developer here in [City]. I'll be quick
because I know you're busy.

I noticed [Business Name] has amazing reviews on Google, but when I searched
for your website, I couldn't find one.

Is that something you've been meaning to get to, or are you not interested in
having a website?"
```

**If they say "Not interested":**
```
"No problem, I understand. Can I ask why? Just curious as a local business owner myself."

[Listen to their reason]

"That makes sense. Well, if you ever change your mind, here's my info:
James at 3kpro.services. I specialize in affordable sites for local businesses.

Thanks for your time!"

[Hang up politely - don't push]
```

**If they say "Been meaning to" or "Maybe":**
```
"I figured! Most business owners I talk to want a website but don't have time
to figure it out.

That's exactly what I help with. I handle everything - design, development,
hosting, domain - for one flat fee of $2,000.

And because I'm local, if you ever need changes or have questions, you can
call me directly. No support tickets, no waiting days for a response.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute meeting so I can show you some examples
and answer any questions?

I'm free [Tuesday/Thursday] afternoon if that works for you?"
```

---

## Outreach Method #4: Social Media (LinkedIn/Facebook)

### LinkedIn Message:

```
Hi [Name],

I see you own [Business Name] here in [City] - awesome!
I'm also local (based in [neighborhood]).

I'm a web developer and I noticed you don't have a website listed on your profile.

I specialize in building simple, affordable sites for local businesses like yours.
Unlike big agencies that charge $10K+, I keep it straightforward: $2,000 one-time,
no monthly fees, done in 3 weeks.

Would you be open to a quick chat? I can send you a free mockup to see if it's
a good fit.

Best,
James
```

### Facebook Message (More casual):

```
Hey [Name]!

I'm a local web developer here in [City] and came across [Business Name] on Google.

You guys have killer reviews (seriously, 4.8 stars is no joke!), but I didn't
see a website.

I help local businesses get found online without breaking the bank.

Would you be interested in chatting about a simple, affordable website? I'm not
talking $10K agency pricing - more like $2K one-time, no monthly fees.

Let me know!
```

## The Face-to-Face Meeting Script

**Location:** Coffee shop or their place of business (their preference)

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes

**What to Bring:**
- Laptop/tablet
- Examples of your work (3kpro.services, Xelora)
- Contract template (printed or digital)
- Business cards
- Notepad for notes

### Meeting Flow:

**1. Small Talk (5 minutes)**
- Ask about their business
- Ask how long they've been in business
- Compliment their reviews/reputation
- Build rapport - you're neighbors, not strangers

**2. Identify Their Problem (10 minutes)**
```
"So what made you interested in finally getting a website?"

[Listen to their answer - this is GOLD]

"When people search for [plumbers] in [city], do you think they're calling
the first business they see on Google, or the one without a website?"

[Let them answer]

"Exactly. And here's the thing - you're already doing great with word of mouth.
I'm not trying to change your business model.

I just want to make sure when people DO search for you online - whether it's
a referral checking you out or someone finding you on Google - they see a
professional website that makes them want to call YOU and not your competitor."
```

**3. Show Examples (10 minutes)**
- Show 3kpro.services
- Show Xelora (demonstrates SaaS capabilities)
- Show any other examples (even templates)

**4. Pricing & Timeline (10 minutes)**
```
"Here's how it works:

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: You give me content (photos, text about your services, phone number)
- Week 2: I build the site and send you a preview
- Week 3: You give me feedback, I make changes, we launch

3 weeks from signing to live site.

**Cost:**
- $2,000 one-time payment (normally $2,500, but I'm running a special)
- That includes EVERYTHING:
  → Custom design
  → Mobile-friendly (works on all phones)
  → Contact form
  → Google Maps
  → Domain name ($15/year)
  → FREE hosting forever (no monthly fees)
  → 30 days of support after launch

**Payment:**
- 50% ($1,000) upfront to start
- 50% ($1,000) when site goes live

Does that sound fair?"
```

**5. Handle Final Objections**

**"Can I pay monthly instead?"**
```
"I keep it simple with one-time payments because nobody likes surprise bills.

But I can split it into 2 payments if that helps:
- $1,000 when we start
- $1,000 when it's done

That way you're not paying everything upfront."
```

**"What if I don't like it?"**
```
"Great question. Here's my guarantee:

I'll show you a preview before we launch. If you don't like it, I'll make
changes until you do.

I offer 2 rounds of revisions included in the price. That means we can adjust
colors, layout, wording - whatever you need.

And honestly, in 3 years of doing this, I've never had someone not like their site
because I involve you in the process from day one."
```

**"What about updates later?"**
```
"I include 30 days of support after launch - if anything breaks or you want
small changes, I fix it free.

After that, I charge $75/hour for updates, or you can do a $50/month retainer
for unlimited small updates.

But most businesses don't need updates often - maybe once or twice a year."
```

**6. Close the Deal**
```
"Alright, so here's what I'm hearing: You want a professional website that shows
off your business, works on phones, and doesn't cost a fortune.

I can deliver that in 3 weeks for $2,000 total.

If you're ready to move forward, I can get started this week. I'd just need:
1. $1,000 deposit (Venmo, Zelle, check - whatever works)
2. Your logo (if you have one)
3. A few photos of your work
4. Your business info (phone, email, address, hours)

And I'll have a preview for you by next week.

Sound good?"
```

## Follow-Up Strategy

**Day 1:** Initial contact (in-person, email, or phone)
**Day 3:** Follow-up if no response
**Day 7:** Final follow-up with "last chance" offer
**Day 30:** Re-engage with new angle

**Example Final Follow-Up (Day 7):**
```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to circle back one last time about the website for [Business Name].

I'm wrapping up my discounted slots for this month ($1,500 instead of $2,000),
and I have 1 spot left.

If you're still interested, let me know by Friday and we can lock it in.

If not, no worries - I'll check back in a few months to see if anything's changed.

Thanks,
James
```
