## Outreach Strategy

### **Cold Email Template:**

**Subject:** AI automation for [Industry] - 80% less manual work

```
Hi [Name],

I'm a Google Cloud AI architect based in [City]. I help [industry] businesses deploy AI agents that handle repetitive tasks automatically.

I just deployed a Marketing Agent for [Similar Business] that:
- Generates campaign briefs in 2 minutes (used to take 2 hours)
- Plans social media calendars automatically
- Writes SEO-optimized content
- Saves 15+ hours/week

It's not custom AI from scratch (too expensive). It's Google's pre-built Marketing Agent template, customized for their specific business.

Implementation: $7,500 one-time
Timeline: 4 weeks
ROI: Typically saves $3K+/month in labor costs

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if this makes sense for [Business Name]?

Best,
James

### **LinkedIn Outreach:**

**Connection Request:**
```
Hi [Name], I help [industry] businesses deploy Google AI agents for automation. Saw your profile and thought we might have some overlap. Would love to connect!
```

**Follow-up Message (after connection):**
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Quick question: Does your team spend a lot of time on [specific manual task like "scheduling appointments" or "creating marketing content"]?

I recently deployed a Google AI agent for [similar business] that automated 80% of that work. Saved them 20+ hours/week.

If you're curious how it works, I'd be happy to show you a quick demo (15 min, no sales pitch). Let me know!
```

---

### **In-Person Pitch (if meeting locally):**

**Opening (30 seconds):**
```
"Hi [Name], I'm James. I deploy Google AI agents for businesses like yours.

You know how your team spends hours on [specific task]? I just deployed an AI agent for [similar business] that does 80% of that automatically.

It's not some sci-fi custom AI - it's Google's pre-built agent template, customized for your business.

Can I show you a quick example?"
```

**Demo (5 minutes):**
- Show the agent in action (use your own Xelora Helix as an example)
- Show before/after time savings
- Show pricing vs. hiring another employee

**Close:**
```
"Implementation is $7,500 one-time, takes 4 weeks.

Most businesses save that back in 2-3 months just from reduced labor costs.

Want to move forward? I can start this week."
```

## First Client Strategy (Build Portfolio)

### **Offer #1: Discounted Pilot ($2,000)**

**Target:** Business you already have a relationship with (friend, family, former colleague)

**Pitch:**
```
"I'm launching a new service deploying Google AI agents, and I'm looking for 1 pilot client to build my portfolio.

Normally this is $7,500, but I'll do it for $2,000 if:
1. You give me feedback throughout the process
2. You let me use you as a case study (testimonial + results)
3. You're okay with a 6-week timeline instead of 4 weeks

If it works, you get an $7,500 agent for $2K.
If it doesn't work, I refund you 100%.

Interested?"
```

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need to be an ML scientist?**
A: No. You're deploying pre-built templates and customizing them. Google already built the models.

**Q: What if the agent doesn't work for their use case?**
A: Discovery call is KEY. Qualify them first. If their use case doesn't fit a template, say no.

**Q: How do I handle support after launch?**
A: Offer 30 days free support, then charge $750/mo maintenance or $150/hour for ad-hoc fixes.

**Q: What if they want custom AI?**
A: Refer them to a big agency. You focus on template deployment, not custom ML.

**Q: How do I compete with ChatGPT wrappers?**
A: ChatGPT = toy. Google Agents = enterprise-grade with security, compliance, tool integration, RAG.
