## Competitive Differentiation

**Why 3KPRO Factory vs. competitors:**

1. **Integrated Stack** - All products work together (shared auth, data models)
2. **Agentic AI Core** - Built on Claude/GPT agents, not legacy automation
3. **Engineering-First** - Built by engineers, for engineers
4. **No Vendor Lock-In** - Export data, cancel anytime, own your workflows
5. **Bleeding Edge** - Ship features before competitors know they're needed

**Direct Competitors:**

- PagerDuty (incident mgmt) - We automate the postmortem
- Vanta (compliance) - We're SOC 2-specific and cheaper
- Statsig (feature flags) - We track competitors, not just A/B tests

**Market Position:** "The Stripe of B2B automation tools - simple, powerful, composable."
