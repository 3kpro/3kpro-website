- **Forms**: React Hook Form

- **Repository**: https://github.com/3kpro/3kpro-website

## Tailwind CSS v4 Fixes Applied

- Configured `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
- Removed custom color theme (using Tailwind's default palette)
- Added proper viewport export (separate from metadata)

## Deployment Configuration

### Vercel Settings
- Auto-deploy from `main` branch
- Production builds on every push
- Environment: Node.js 22.x
- Build command: `next build`
- Output directory: Next.js default

### Custom Domain Configuration
Domain `3kpro.services` is configured with:
- Main domain alias
- WWW subdomain alias
- Automatic SSL certificates
- Global CDN distribution

## DNS Requirements

```
Type    Name    Value
A       @       76.76.21.21
CNAME   www     cname.vercel-dns.com
```

const response = await fetch('/api/contact', {

})
